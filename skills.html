				<h3>Levels</h3>
				<p>
					There are 23 different skills available to train in Old School Runescape. Each of the skills start at level 1
					(with the exception of hitpoints, which starts at 10), and can be trained to a maximum level of 99. This results in a maximum
					total level of 2277.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each level gained in a skill grants a slight bonus to that skill, with certain milestone levels unlocking different content.
					Each action performed related to the skill grants a small amount of experience points. The experience needed for each level
					starts out small, at 81 xp needed to advance to level 2. However, each subsequent level requires exponentially more experience,
					resulting in a total of 13 million experience to reach level 99.
