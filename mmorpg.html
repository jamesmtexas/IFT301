				<h3>What is an MMORPG?</h3>
				<p>
					MMO stands for "Massively Multiplayer Online". Unlike a traditional multiplayer video game where only a handful of players will be in the same game session, MMOs
					consist of thousands or even millions of concurrent players all in the same world. The term MMO in general does not describe the genre of game.
				</p>
				<p>An MMORPG is a Role Playing Game (RPG) which is an MMO. While a "Role Playing Game" can be any setting or style of gameplay, tradiationally MMORPGs use a fantasy setting, similar to Dungeons and Dragons.
				A common theme among MMORPGs is the focus on character progression. Typically, this takes the form of gathering experience points and leveling up, as well as collecting gear to become more powerful.</p>
				<p>Another common MMORPG component is a player driven economy - items can be traded and are valued according to player perception.</p>
				<p>Finally, many MMORPGs have a focus on role-based combat, using the triad of Tank, Healer, and Damage roles.</p>
